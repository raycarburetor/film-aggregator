Following a decades-long fascination with the horror genre, a married couple buys an abandoned duplex to use as a location for filming their low-budget scary movie. They soon notice that random strangers are drawn to the old building, but never approach it, merely standing outside and staring at it in a sort of trance. Delighted to find themselves embroiled in a real-life scary story, the two team up with an old friend and put their years of horror expertise, amateur ghost hunting, and paranormal obsession to use in the hope of discovering why this building holds such a strange power over people.",
