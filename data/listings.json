Prim and prissy Albin is the star attraction at La Cage Aux Folles, a popular drag nightclub on the French Riviera, while his comparatively macho boyfriend Renato is the club’s owner. Together they live in domestic (almost) bliss, a status quo which is threatened when Renato’s son Laurent brings his charming fiancée Andrea to visit – along with her ultra-conservative parents! Based on the 1973 play which would later be adapted into both a hit Broadway musical and a Hollywood remake, this first film version was a watershed moment in on-screen LGBT representation and remains a riotously funny social satire.

    "synopsis": "Down-on-his-luck veteran Tsugumo Hanshirō enters the courtyard of the prosperous House of Iyi. Unemployed, and with no family, he hopes to find a place to commit seppuku—and a worthy second to deliver the coup de grâce in his suicide ritual. The senior counselor for the Iyi clan questions the ronin’s resolve and integrity, suspecting Hanshirō of seeking charity rather than an honorable end. What follows is a pair of interlocking stories which lay bare the difference between honor and respect, and promises to examine the legendary foundations of the Samurai code.",

Each film, ranging from 3 to 7 minutes, presents a unique perspective on the current reality in Gaza. The project captures the diverse experiences of life in the Palestinian enclave, including the challenges, tragedies, and moments of resilience faced by its people. With a mix of genres such as fiction, documentary, docu-fiction, animation, and experimental cinema, \"From Ground Zero\" showcases a rich tapestry of stories that reflect the sorrow, joy, and hope inherent in Gazan life.",
